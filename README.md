### Reactjs Basic

calculator functionality:

- 3 inputs only for numbers,
- 4 actions: add, substract, multiply, divide,
- clear button,
- result can be marked and copied, can't be manipulated by input
- Checkbox not working

I am still a newbie and there are still many shortcomings, I don't understand the basic logic of programming.

I studied and searched for sourcodes from github to github, youtube and documentation.
